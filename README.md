Stage 2: First trial with PyTorch and build up a Multi-Layer Perceptron model to classify the instances in a provided dataset.  
Stage 3: Object recognition from images with convolutional neural network model.  
Stage 4: Text classification and generation with recurrent neural network models.  
Stage 5: Network embedding and node classification with graph neural network models.  


To run code for stage 3, please install torchvision.
